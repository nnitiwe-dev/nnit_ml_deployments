# Research Paper Search Pipeline with Scrapy and Elasticsearch

This repository contains the source code for building a full-text research paper search pipeline using Scrapy and Elasticsearch. The pipeline allows you to scrape research paper data from Arxiv using Scrapy spiders and index the extracted data into Elasticsearch, enabling powerful search and retrieval capabilities.

## Project Overview

The project aims to provide a comprehensive tutorial and implementation guide for entry-level data engineers to build a research paper search pipeline. It leverages Scrapy, a web scraping framework, to extract data from Arxiv and utilizes Elasticsearch, a distributed search engine, for indexing and searching the scraped research papers.

## Features

- Scrape research paper data from Arxiv using Scrapy spiders.
- Clean and preprocess the scraped data using Scrapy Item Pipeline.
- Index the extracted data into Elasticsearch for efficient full-text search.
- Implement search functionality to retrieve research papers based on keywords or specific criteria.
- Customize and extend the pipeline to suit specific requirements.
